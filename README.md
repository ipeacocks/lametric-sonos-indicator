This indicator shows current song which Sonos plays on Lametric Clock. Script should be launched externally on some 3rd system (maybe like [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)) in your local network. Unfortunately [official Lametric application](https://apps.lametric.com/apps/display_for_sonos/4961) is buggy and doesn't work correct at least for me. 

## Requirements

This panel is written on next libraries:

* [SoCo](https://github.com/SoCo/SoCo)
* Requests

## Installation

Clone code:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:ipeacocks/lametric-sonos-indicator.git
```
Simply create virtualenv:
```
$ cd lametric-sonos-indicator
$ python3 -m venv venv
```
Activate virtual env:
```
$ source venv/bin/activate
```
That's almost it. Use `requirments.txt` to setup all python dependencies:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Rename `settings.py_example` to `settings.py`, fill [IP address and API key](https://lametric-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/first-steps/first-local-notification.html#find-api-key) of your lametric in it and launch:
```
$ python3 main_class.py
```
That's it. Hope it would be useful for you.
